# Twitter-Fake-News-Detection

We connect on the Twitter API and gather tweets of two accounts: BBCBreaking (real news) and BurrardStreetJ (fake news). Our goal is to find patterns on plots and graphs that would indicate if the tweet is real or fake. 

- Plots: retweet count VS time, users per hop VS number of hops

- Graph: number of hops

The results indicate clear patterns that distinguish real and fake news. Each category follows its own distribution of data, and this distribution is different on real vs fake. Some examples can be found in the folder "results".

The Survey examines the information diffusion in Social Networks and what happens in the case of Fake News. The Presentation contains the basic points of the survey, together with the results of our project.
